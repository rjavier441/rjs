Redux is a state manager where we want our data to be kept in the front end
//state: Data we want to display when component (think of it as file)
//       is being rendered
//props: Data which we GIVE to a component (read only)
//render: Basically what we want to display; output is a REACT ELEMENT -> maps to virtual DOM element which maps to actual DOM
